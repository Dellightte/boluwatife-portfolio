<p>I’m a creative writer and WordPress designer.<br>
  I write as you would speak. And I can have your WordPress website running in no time.</p>

<p>I like thinking. I like helping others. I like believing the best is possible. I don’t like regrets — and don’t stay in it.<br>
  I’m 25 years old. From Ife, Nigeria, Earth.</p>
